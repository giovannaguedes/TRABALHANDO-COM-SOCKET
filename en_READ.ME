üìù Guide: Creating and Running a Python Script with Socket

This script will attempt to connect to an IP address and port provided by the user.
It does not perform any unauthorized actions: it only checks whether the port is open or closed.

1. Create the script file

In the terminal:

nano script4.3.py

2. Python Code (corrected and explained)

Paste the provided code.

3. Give execution permission (optional)

If you want to run it directly as a program:

chmod +x script4.3.py

4. Run the script
./script4.3.py

5. Example of execution
M!ss s3c - Port Test
Enter IP: 127.0.0.1
Enter port: 22
Port 22 is open on host 127.0.0.1


Or:

M!ss s3c - Port Test
Enter IP: 127.0.0.1
Enter port: 8080
Port 8080 is closed on host 127.0.0.1

üëâ What you learned here

import socket ‚Üí library to work with networking in Python.

socket.socket() ‚Üí creates a TCP socket.

connect_ex() ‚Üí attempts a connection; returns 0 if successful (port is open).

Timeout (settimeout) ‚Üí prevents the script from freezing.

Close the socket (close()) ‚Üí always important to release resources.
